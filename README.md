# Boilerplate

### Stack

React (packages for redux, router are included but not set up in the example)

Webpack

Font Awesome

React-Bootstrap

Typescript

Express

Heroku (deploy)

## Installation

```
$ yarn
```

## Running

```
$ yarn start
```

Dev mode

```
$ yarn dev
```

## Info

Files will be added to the 'build' folder. Webpack dev server is included, but not set up - so pages will require manual refresh (Ctrl + R).

Deployed example app : https://boilerplatets.herokuapp.com/

## Todos 
Optimize build through webpack as it sometimes fails on Heroku but on the second retry succeeds. I've confirmed it works with quite large apps. 

Any advice, feedback or pull requests are welcome.
